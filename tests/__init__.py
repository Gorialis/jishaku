jishaku unit & integration tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most of these are unit, not integration, tests.
Integration tests are much harder to do for networked applications with service dependencies.

Some manual tests exist for specific circumstances.

At the moment all manual tests *could* probably reasonably be integration tests,
so this should be done at some point in the future.

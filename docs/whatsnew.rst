.. currentmodule:: jishaku

What's new?
================

Version 2.5.2
-------------

This version is a **backport release** to fix 3.12 and some other long-standing compatibility bugs.

This **does not** contain any new features from master - it is a special bug fix only release. You can see the exact changes by `comparing tags on GitHub <https://github.com/Gorialis/jishaku/compare/2.5.1...2.5.2>`.

Version 2.5.1
-------------

This version includes:

- Some fixes for changes that broke existing fork support
- A fix for ``jsk pip`` that tries to select the right pip for the current Python when a venv is not correctly activated.
- Additional shortcut 'scaffold' methods that allow you to easily leverage some compilers/interpreters via the shell when detected.
- If a REPL (``jsk py``, etc) contains mentions and fails to compile as is, jishaku will attempt to substitute the mentions with a respective object. This allows you to use mentions as literals when not in a codeblock.
- Some reaction-related functionality has been adjusted to try and avoid sending reactions when it's not necessary. This is to account for the new, slower, reaction rate limits. Note that some of these benefits only apply to 2.0a+ users.
- An experimental ``jsk timeit`` command that attempts to do line-based timing evaluation of Python code. This isn't super reliable as is, and generally should not be used for small or absolute measurements, but rather to find large snags that could be bottlenecking.

Version 2.5.0
-------------

This version adds mostly-complete strict typing to the library, supporting type checkers using the public API.

``jsk sync`` has also been improved, now including a diagnostic for commands that fail to sync,
and the ability to use ``$`` to sync global commands, ``.`` to sync the current guild, and ``*`` to sync all known guilds.

Version 2.4.0
-------------

discord.py has now resumed development, and this version allows the cog to be loaded with the new 2.0a async load strategy.

As it stands, jishaku will now once again handle discord.py as its first class priority for support.
However, jishaku will still **no longer serve discord.py as a requirement** and fork-specific fixes up to this point will remain, with future ones still being considered based on their impact.

It is still thus up to you what you decide to use with jishaku, and the module will not make this choice for you, but be aware that discord.py-related bugs will be prioritized for fixes over other implementations.

New stuff in this release:

- jishaku will now correctly provide and use async setup/add_cog/load_extension on 2.0a
- ``__main__`` has been improved to allow you to specify a log file to output to in addition to stdout.
- ``WrappedPaginator`` performance has been improved over tenfold, reducing lag from extremely large outputs
- The ``jsk sync`` command has been added, allowing you to sync either your global or guild-specific app_commands.
- ``jsk pyi`` now by default includes the help text on objects when it can find it, making it quicker to determine how to use functions and classes.
- The ``jsk ast`` command has been added, which takes in code and produces a colourful AST breakdown tree.
- The ``jsk`` command will now correctly detect and display the version of the source of the ``discord`` package on forks.
- The ``jsk`` command will now show whether the ``message_content`` intent is enabled or not.
- The ``jsk sh`` support will now attempt to preserve and properly display ANSI when it is possible to do so.
- The ``jsk sh`` command has a new alias: ``jsk terminal``.
- The ``jsk vc ytdl`` command will now prioritize ``yt-dlp`` when it's available to take advantage of the reduced staggering.
- The ``ALWAYS_DM_TRACEBACK`` flag has been added to always DM tracebacks, even for syntax errors.
- The ``USE_ANSI_ALWAYS`` and ``USE_ANSI_NEVER`` flags have been added to override ANSI use in commands that support it.
- Typing has been improved across the module.

Version 2.3.2
-------------

Fixed a regression from 2.3.1 that made permtrace return bad results on 1.7.2


Version 2.3.1
-------------

This is a patch release to fix a number of issues with permtrace and improve ``__main__``.


Version 2.3.0
-------------

As discord.py development has ceased, this update serves to set the expectations for Jishaku going forward.

I have already gone over everything in my README writeup, so I will reproduce it here for your convenience.

    As of the 27th of August 2021, `discord.py has ceased development <https://gist.github.com/Rapptz/4a2f62751b9600a31a0d3c78100287f1>`_.

    Jishaku will continue to be maintained targeting both the PyPI version and the `latest git revision <https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/tree/45d498c1b76deaf3b394d17ccf56112fa691d160>`_ as of the archive, until at least the date of the slash command mandate (currently speculated to be around April 2022).

    As all trusted contributors have rejected continuing the library, I do not have enough trust in any forks to target those instead. The existing forks are handled by inexperienced developers, and I figure this will continue to be the case in the future, as all of the developers experienced enough to carry the torch do not want to maintain the library for similar reasons to Danny himself.

    However, if you personally decide that you wish to use a fork, I will allow Jishaku to honor your decision by removing the ``discord.py`` package requirement. **This means, from now on, installing jishaku will not automatically handle installing discord.py, you must choose a version to use yourself**. Any fork that you use must be compatible with the original (in that it supplies the ``discord`` module and its namespaces).

    When April 2022 comes, I will make a decision at the time as to whether I want to continue maintaining Jishaku. I still enjoy making and maintaining bots, but implementing Jishaku under the philosophies I have defined so far will likely be impossible under the new slash commands, and I don't really want to compromise my work for the sake of appeasing a company that doesn't care for its developers.

    I hope you've found Jishaku useful, and hopefully it will get to live on in one way or another.


Version 2.2.0
-------------

The ``jsk sudo``, ``jsk su`` and ``jsk in`` commands have been removed and replaced with a single command that handles all three at once.

``jsk exec`` now automatically handles IDs or mentions for channels, users, or threads (only with discord v2.0a+).
Aliases with a postfix ``!`` bypass checks and cooldowns, like ``jsk sudo`` used to do.

Example of how the commands change with this release:

- ``jsk su @user command`` -> ``jsk exec @user command``
- ``jsk in #channel command`` -> ``jsk exec #channel command``
- ``jsk in #channel jsk su @user command`` -> ``jsk exec #channel @user command`` or ``jsk exec @user #channel command``
- ``jsk sudo command`` -> ``jsk exec! command``

This allows combinations that were previously not possible, for example,
``jsk exec! #channel @user command`` now executes a command as a user in another channel or thread, bypassing any checks or cooldowns that user or channel has against the command.

The flag system (i.e. the ``JISHAKU_FLAG=...`` system) has been rewritten to use various degrees of lazy evaluation.
This means setting flags like ``JISHAKU_HIDE`` and ``JISHAKU_RETAIN`` need only precede loading the Jishaku extension, as opposed to the entire module.

Flags that only evaluated at command runtime will now have their changes take effect immediately.
For example, executing ``os.environ['JISHAKU_NO_UNDERSCORE'] = '1'`` no longer requires a reload to take effect.

A programmatic interface for flags is available, however, its use is discouraged except in subclass initialization, due to the fact that the changes will **NOT** persist across reloads of the extension.

.. code:: python3

    jishaku.Flags.NO_UNDERSCORE = True

The ``jsk invite`` command has been added, which is a developer convenience command that supplies the invite link for the bot it is ran on.
This command is most useful for bots that predate the behavior change that merged bot and application IDs, saving the time of having to retrieve the application ID yourself.

Permissions can be supplied, e.g., ``jsk invite kick_members manage_messages`` will create an invite requesting those two permissions.

The invites produced request slash commands for convenience.

Some regressions have been fixed and other internal cleanup has been addressed in this release.

Version 2.1.0
-------------

A new implementation of PaginatorInterface has been created using Discord's interaction buttons system.
It is available when using discord.py 2.0.0 or greater (currently alpha).

Jishaku will now avoid uploading files either when detecting the author is on mobile or through an explicit ``JISHAKU_FORCE_PAGINATOR`` switch.
This is to better support mobile platforms that do not have inline file previews yet. (`PR #111 <https://github.com/Gorialis/jishaku/pull/111>`_).

Humanize has been removed as a dependency. Selftest now uses Discord's own relative timestamp formatting markdown extension for timing,
and pretty printing of memory usage has been implemented within the Feature itself.

Version 2.0.0
--------------

Python version changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python version 3.7 has been dropped. Jishaku 2.0 requires Python 3.8 or greater.

New commands
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``jsk rtt``
    Calculates the round-trip time between your bot and the Discord API.
    Reports exact values as well as an average and standard deviation.

- ``jsk dis``
    Disassembles a given piece of Python code in REPL context, returning the bytecode.
    This does not actually execute the code, but can be used to identify compiler behavior and optimizations.

- ``jsk permtrace``
    Calculates the effect of permissions and overwrites on a given member or set of roles in a channel.
    This can be used to identify why a member does, or does not, have a permission in a given place.

Command improvements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- ``jsk``
    Information on sharding status for both automatically and manually sharded bots is now displayed.

    The root 'jsk' command can now be sanely overridden, removed, or renamed using the Feature system.

- ``jsk py`` / ``jsk pyi``
    Exceptions now display the line from which they originate, instead of just the line number.

    Large results that fit within the Discord preview threshold are now uploaded as files,
    for better navigability.

- ``jsk sh``
    Timeout has been increased from 90 seconds from invocation, to 120 seconds from the last output.

    This should reduce the chance of termination from long-running installs or other processes.

- ``jsk source``
    Triple backticks inside of source files no longer cause the file content to spill outside of its codeblock.

    Large results that fit within the Discord preview threshold are now uploaded as files,
    for better navigability.

- ``jsk vc``
    Voice commands no longer appear if their relevant dependencies are not installed.

- ``jsk shutdown``
    Now uses ``bot.close`` to prevent deprecation warnings.

    Fixed a regression with braille J support.

API changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Feature system
    The Feature system has been implemented as a means to solve subclassing problems with Jishaku.

    Certain functionality can now be disabled in subclasses, additional commands can be easily facilitated
    without affecting the native Jishaku cog, and overriding subcommands or groups is now possible without
    needing to reimplement commands that would otherwise become orphaned in the process.

- PaginatorInterface
    Updating mechanism has been entirely rewritten to better prevent cascades of message edits.

    This change has also made it possible to synchronously trigger interface updates, paving the way for
    possible native stream or TextIO support in the future.
